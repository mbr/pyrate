		The system uses "rating periods" - all games during a rating period are applied at the same time, a players
		rating can only change after a period. It is possible, however, to use a rating period of 'one game', as is
		done by the FICS (Free Internet Chess Server). In the original paper, a rating period that encompasses a
		"moderate" of games, i.e. 5-10 on average, is recommended [1].

		c_squared is a constant, see the calc_c_squared() method for details. It is recommended to call calc_c_squared()
		after instantiating this rating system.

		As suggested in [1], rd_floor is a value below rd may never fall. Otherwise a player could get 'stuck'
		at a certain rating without being able to improve upon, becaues his RD is very small.

		The initial_rating and initial_rd parameters are not normally changed, this is different from
		the ELO system.

		`initial_data` can be used to start with set ratings for some players. This dictionary should have the same
		structure as the return value of calculate_ratings.

		`get_period_func` is a function that should return the absolute period number
		for a game (the difference between two game's period's is used to calculate the
		time a player has been inactive)
